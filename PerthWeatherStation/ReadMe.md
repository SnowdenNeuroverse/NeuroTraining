# Perth Weather Station Completed Tutorial

The notebooks in this folder contain the completed Perth weather station tutorial. This tutorial is intended to give the user experience with working with data in Neuroverse. The tutorial will expose the user to the following:
1. Basic data management
2. Using Spark interactively to investigate data
3. Using Spark as a scheduled batch job to create a data pipeline
4. Exploring data using a SQL server directly

This tutorial uses the default spark cluster, a sql store and a data lake. It assumes they have been created and configured for use.

The suggested workflow is to have the github notebook open in a browser tab and rewrite the contents of the tutorial notebook in a new Neuroverse notebook. This approach will encourage you to understand the code rather than just copy it.
